# 📘 Month 01 – Core Foundations  
**Focus:** SQL (Fundamentals → Advanced), Statistics (Basics → Advanced)  

---

## 🗂️ SQL Fundamentals  
- Write queries using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`  
- Practice inserting data using `INSERT`  
- Filter, sort, and retrieve specific records  
- Understand data types and basic table structures  

---

## 🔄 SQL Intermediate  
- Perform table joins: `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL OUTER`  
- Use set operations: `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`  
- Aggregate data with `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and built-in functions  
- Apply `CASE WHEN` for conditional logic  

---

## 🧠 SQL Advanced  
- Master subqueries (correlated and uncorrelated)  
- Use window functions: `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`  
- Explore query optimization: indexing, execution plans  
- Work through complex SQL challenges (StrataScratch, LeetCode, etc.)  

---

## 📊 Statistics Basics  
- Learn measures of central tendency: **mean, median, mode**  
- Understand dispersion: **variance, standard deviation, range**  
- Study basic probability concepts and simple distributions  
- Introduction to correlation and covariance  

---

## 📈 Statistics Advanced  
- Explore probability distributions: **normal, binomial, Poisson**  
- Learn hypothesis testing: **t-test, chi-square test, p-value**  
- Understand regression basics and statistical inference  
- Study more complex correlation methods and their applications
