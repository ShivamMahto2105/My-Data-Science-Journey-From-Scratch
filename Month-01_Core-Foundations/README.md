**Focus:** DBMS, SQL (Basic + Advanced), Statistics  

---

### â™¦ DBMS  
- Understand the basics of databases and their importance  
- Learn ER models, relationships, and different types of keys  
- Study schema design and normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)  

---

### â™¦ SQL (Basics)  
- Write queries using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`  
- Practice `JOINS` to combine data from multiple tables  
- Use `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` for aggregation  
- Regular practice with problem sets to strengthen skills  

---

### â™¦ SQL (Advanced)  
- Learn advanced topics like **subqueries** and **window functions**  
- Explore `CASE WHEN`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, and `ROW_NUMBER()`  
- Optimize queries using indexing and execution plans  
- Work on complex SQL challenges from platforms like StrataScratch or LeetCode  

---

### â™¦ Statistics  
- Learn basic statistics: **mean, median, variance, standard deviation**  
- Understand probability distributions (normal, binomial, Poisson)  
- Study correlation and covariance  
- Introduction to hypothesis testing (t-test, chi-square test, p-value)
